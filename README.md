## Dependency Installation
Tested on Ubuntu 22.04.05 with ROS Humble.

*NOTE*: I would recommend removing sourcing of conda in .bashrc and deactivating active environments prior to installing the following dependencies. Some of the unitree installations encounter issues with base conda environments.

### Eigen
https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download

Install eigen by clolning under /opt

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git
```

### ROS
If you don't yet have ROS Humble installed, follow the instructions at [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html].

Install the following additional ROS Humble packages as well:
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-joy
sudo apt install ros-humble-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp
sudo apt install ros-humble-rosidl-generator-dds-idl
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
sudo apt install ros-humble-rosidl-generator-dds-idl
```


```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libyaml-cpp-dev
```

### Unitree

There are now several unitree dependencies that we need to clone and setup. Clone all of the following repos under the /opt/unitree_robotics directory (necessary for cmake to properly link the packages). 

```bash
mkdir unitree_robotics
git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2.git &&
git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros2 && 
git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco
```

Within each of the cloned repos, follow the setup instructions from unitree in the respective README on github for each repo. We also provide instructions on setting up additional necessary dependencies under each repo.

1. Unitree SDK2
Follow the setup instructions under the README at: [https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2)

```bash
cd unitree_sdk2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/unitree_robotics
sudo make install
```

2. Unitree ROS2
Follow the setup instructions under the README at: [https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros2]

Remove sourcing of your default ROS workspace from .bashrc if it exists. Make sure that no active workspace is sourced before running the rest of the commands.

Compile cyclonedds
```bash
cd /opt/unitree_robotics/unitree_ros2/cyclonedds_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros2/rmw_cyclonedds -b humble
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds -b releases/0.10.x 
cd ..
colcon build --packages-select cyclonedds
```

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash 
colcon build
```

Update setup file to work with humble
```bash
gedit setup_local.sh
replace foxy with humble
```
replace source $HOME/unitree_ros2/cyclonedds_ws/install/setup.bash with source /opt/unitree_robotics/unitree_ros2/cyclonedds_ws/install/setup.bash

3. Unitree MuJoCo
Follow the setup instructions under the README at: [[https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros2](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco)]. However, **make sure to install MuJoCo with the instructions below first** to install MuJoCo 3.2.7 specifically. The unitree_mujoco instructions point to a newer version of MuJoCo which is no longer compatible with their code.

Install MuJoCo
```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco.git
cd /mujoco
git checkout 3.2.7
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install
```

```bash
cd /opt/unitree_robotics/unitree_mujoco/simulate
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```



The unitree_mujoco repo only publishes a subset of their /sportmodestate topic when simulating with mujoco. Our code relies on the topic for foot location information, so we need to modify /simulate/src/unitree_sdk2_bridge.cpp to broadcast foot positions from MuJoCo. Modify PublishHighState() method to the following and rebuild the repo.
```cpp
void UnitreeSdk2Bridge::PublishHighState()
{
    if (mj_data_ && have_frame_sensor_)
    {

        high_state_.position()[0] = mj_data_->sensordata[dim_motor_sensor_ + 10];
        high_state_.position()[1] = mj_data_->sensordata[dim_motor_sensor_ + 11];
        high_state_.position()[2] = mj_data_->sensordata[dim_motor_sensor_ + 12];

        high_state_.velocity()[0] = mj_data_->sensordata[dim_motor_sensor_ + 13];
        high_state_.velocity()[1] = mj_data_->sensordata[dim_motor_sensor_ + 14];
        high_state_.velocity()[2] = mj_data_->sensordata[dim_motor_sensor_ + 15];

        std::array<int, 4> foot_indices = {5, 9, 13, 17};
        
        // Custom foot position publish
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
        {
            high_state_.foot_position_body()[3*i + 0] = mj_data_->xpos[3*foot_indices[i] + 0];
            high_state_.foot_position_body()[3*i + 1] = mj_data_->xpos[3*foot_indices[i] + 1];
            high_state_.foot_position_body()[3*i + 2] = mj_data_->xpos[3*foot_indices[i] + 2];

            high_state_.foot_speed_body()[3*i + 0] = mj_data_->cvel[6*foot_indices[i] + 3]; // vx
            high_state_.foot_speed_body()[3*i + 1] = mj_data_->cvel[6*foot_indices[i] + 4]; // vy
            high_state_.foot_speed_body()[3*i + 2] = mj_data_->cvel[6*foot_indices[i] + 5]; // vz
        }

        high_state_puber_->Write(high_state_);
    }
}
```



### Gurobi Optimizer
The convex MPC controller requires Gurobi optimization solver:

1. Download and install Gurobi from https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/
2. Obtain a license (academic licenses are free for academic use)
3. Place your license file (typically named gurobi.lic) in your home directory
<!-- 4. Set the environment variable before running:
   ```bash
   export GRB_LICENSE_FILE="/home/daniel/gurobi.lic"
   ```
5. For persistent setup, add to your .bashrc:
   ```bash
   echo 'export GRB_LICENSE_FILE="/home/daniel/gurobi.lic"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ``` -->

### Pinocchio
```bash
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-pinocchio
```

# Running the Controller in Simulation & Physical Robot 
## Simulation (MuJoCo)
Source the following bash file:
```bash
source setup_local.sh
```

Navigate to the unitree_mujoco repo and run the following executable to launch an instance of a MuJoCo environment with the Go2. This publishes unitree ROS topics /sportmodestate and /lowstate which our controller subscribes to for state information. The MuJoCo environment also subscribes to /lowcmd, which is where our controller publishes joint torque commands.
```bash
cd /opt/unitree_robotics/unitree_mujoco/simulate/build
./unitree_mujoco
```

Plug in an xbox controller. In a new terminal (also sourcing setup_local.sh), start the convex_mpc controller by launching the ROS node as shown below. The controller tracks a reference trajectory based on the joystick inputs.
```bash
ros2 launch convex_mpc convex_mpc_launch.py
```


## Physical Go2 Robot
Connect the Go2 via ethernet.
Source the following bash file (Make sure your Go2 ethernet IP is configured correctly based on the instructions in the unitree_ros2 repo):
```bash
source setup.sh
```

# Updating Controller Hyperparameters
The controller uses ROS parameters via the launch file to configure various settings related to the MPC formulation and gait planning. These can be changed by modifying /src/convex_mpc/config/convex_mpc_params.yaml. The structure of the params file is shown below:

```yaml
/convex_mpc_controller:
  ros__parameters:
    N_MPC: 10
    Q_scale: 50.0
    mpc_dt: 0.025
    mass: 15.7
    JOINT_TORQUE_PUBLISH_RATE_MS: 2
    MPC_STATE_UPDATE_RATE_MS: 25
    mu_static_friction: 0.25
    footstep_planning_horizon_s: 0.1
    # Q_diag: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 100.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0]
    Q_diag: [1.0, 5.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 100.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 8.0, 0.0]
    qos_overrides:
      /parameter_events:
        publisher:
          depth: 1000
          durability: volatile
          history: keep_last
          reliability: reliable
    use_sim_time: false
```

Brief explanation of the variables:
- N_MPC: # of timesteps in the MPC planning horizon
- Q_scale: Scaling factor on the quadratic state cost in LQR, where $' Q = Q_{scale} \times diag(Q_diag) '$
- mpc_dt: Rate in seconds that MPC resolves for GRFs
- q_diag: Diagonal terms in the quadratic state cost for LQR, where $Q = Q_scale*diag(Q_diag)$
- MPC_STATE_UPDATE_RATE_MS: Rate at which the current robot state $\bf{x_0}$ is updated within the controller (the initial state for the dynamics rollout within the solver)
- mass: Weight of the rigid body approximation of the quadruped 
- mu_static_friction: static friction between the quadruped feet and ground (modifies the friction cone constraint in the solver)
- footstep_planning_horizon_s: planning horizon in seconds for planning footstep locations (this must be at least as long as the mpc horizon $N_MPC \times mpc_dt$)
